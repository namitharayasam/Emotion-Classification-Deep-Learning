# Emotion Classification Deep Learning Model

This project implements a simple beginner-friendly deep learning-based emotion classification model trained on a custom dataset. 

## Features

- **Custom Dataset Support**: Train the model using your own dataset of labeled emotions.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Uses a neural network for accurate classification.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans and preprocesses input data for better training efficiency.
- **Train & Evaluate**: Supports model training, validation, and performance evaluation.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Provides predictions on new input data.

## Dataset Format

The dataset consists of a set of labelled images for each emotion.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)**
- **Matplotlib (for visualization)**
